			<h3>The Problem</h3>

			<!-- Grid Example -->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="large-12 columns">
					<p>In Census Tract 9 (Rocksprings area) where the median household income is $15,536/year and 54% of households are in poverty, Broadband connection rates are 20-40%. Compare this to Census Tract 17 (Normaltown/ARMC area) where the median income is $53,214/year, only 9% of households are in poverty and broadband subscription is 80-100%. <a href="http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/investigations/broadband-adoption/htmlmulti/broadband-adoption-map/">Broadband adoption rates</a></p>
          <p>There is a direct correlation between the income, skill level, and broadband subscription rate for areas that have access to broadband internet. The higher the subscription rate for an area translates to a higher graduation and post-secondary education rate, higher median income, and a higher rated skill level.</p>
          <p>With organisations such as Caterpillar and the University of Georgia, Athens requires a deep pool of educated, highly skilled workers to fill open positions. We believe that by finding a solution to provide low or no cost broadband internet access to low-income areas in Athens, we can improve the overall quality of life and economic prospects for populations living in those areas. Also, providing an internet connection to low-income families opens the door for other training and educational programs targeting those families.</p>
          <p>The UN has declared high speed internet access to be a basic human right. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access">UN Declares Internet a basic human right</a></p>

			<h3>Solution</h3>

      <div id="our-solution" class="row">
        <h4>Bandwidth is a non-renewable resource</h4>
        <p>Our solution aims to take unused and under-utilised bandwidth and re-invest it in the community through access to broadband internet. This is our hack - getting local businesses and community organisations including churches, hospitals, and public service organisations to share and re-invest their unused bandwidth in low-income neighborhoods to provide Internet connections that will allow for increased opportunities in education, skilled training, and economic growth.</p>
        <p>Why would businesses want to do this? We envision using a technology that will allow for branded splash pages when users connect to any particular node that recognises and promotes the business that is serving that connection. Doing this will inspire goodwill in the community as well as raise the recognition of that business as a community involved organisation.</p>
        <p>How do we do this? Using a technology called <a href="http://www.open-mesh.com">Open Mesh</a>, we can go into these local businesses and provide them with hardware (in essence, a wireless router that re-transmits their Internet connection) that they can either attach directly to their existing network or replace their current hardware. We then place other nodes in the low-income areas we are looking to support that attach to and extend the network created from these businesses, creating a mesh network that is fault-tolerant against environmental and power issues.</p>
