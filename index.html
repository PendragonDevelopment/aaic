			<h3>The Problem</h3>

			<!-- Grid Example -->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="large-12 columns">
					<p>In Census Tract 9 (Rocksprings area) where the median household income is $15,536/year and 54% of households are in poverty, Broadband connection rates are 20-40%. Compare this to Census Tract 17 (Normaltown/ARMC area) where the median income is $53,214/year, only 9% of households are in poverty and broadband subscription is 80-100%. <a href="http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/investigations/broadband-adoption/htmlmulti/broadband-adoption-map/">Broadband adoption rates</a></p>
          <p>There is a direct correlation between the income, skill level, and broadband subscription rate for areas that have access to broadband internet. The higher the subscription rate for an area translates to a higher graduation and post-secondary education rate, higher median income, and a higher rated skill level.</p>
          <p>With organizations such as Caterpillar and the University of Georgia, Athens requires a deep pool of educated, highly skilled workers to fill open positions. We believe that by finding a solution to provide low or no cost broadband internet access to low-income areas in Athens, we can improve the overall quality of life and economic prospects for populations living in those areas. Also, providing an internet connection to low-income families opens the door for other training and educational programs targeting those families.</p>
          <p>The UN has declared high speed internet access to be a basic human right. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access">UN Declares Internet a basic human right</a></p>
